# ng-tss-tool
Estimate TSS on the web, tss.darin.xyz

## Usage
If you track your cycling fitness through TSS, then you'll know the frustration of going on a ride without power. 
Your power meter battery might have died mid ride, not worked at all, or you were on a ride without a power meter altogether. 
The ng-tss-tool is built to currently perform three actions:

1. Estimate TSS of a ride based on heart rate values found in the file and an FTP value that you enter.
1. Add an average power to your ride in order for you to have a TSS that you enter based on your FTP.
1. Add an average power to your ride that you enter.

#1. Based on average heart rate.
If you have heart rate data and you know your zones, this webapp will estimate your TSS using a function derived from Joe Friel's blog post ["Estimating Training Stress Score (TSS)"](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/estimating-training-stress-score-tss/)
Upload your file and expand the first section on the right.
